used Terminology

IAAS(Infrastructure as a Service)


Container - Docker 
Create DOcker images for each microservice
Docker image has all needs of a microservice:
APplication Runtime(JDK or python or NOdejs)
Application code and Dependancies
VMS vitualize Hardware while containers vitualize Os
Runs the same way on way on any infrastructure:
your local machine
corporate data center
cloud

Advantages
Docker COntainers are light weigh
Compared to vitual MAchines as they do not have a GUest Os
Docker provides isolation  for containers
Docker is CLode neutral

Container Orchestration
Requirements: I want 10 instances of MIcroserice A container,15 instances of Microservice B container and ...
TYpes Features:
Auto Scaling :Scale container based on demand
Service Discovery -Help microservice find one other
Load Balancer --Distribute load among multiple instances of a microservice.
Self Healing --Do health checks and replace failing instances
Zero Downtime Deployments -Release new version without Downtime

     database -------standbydatabase
     
 INcress AVAIABILTY AND DAurability of databases
 
 inCREssing Availbity
 Have multipal stondbys available or DIstribute the database
  -in multipal ZOnes
   -in multipal Regions
   
 INcreasiang DAURABILTY :
 mULTIPAL copies of data (STandbys ,shapshots, transction logs and replicas)
 --in multipal Zones
  --in multipal Regions
 Replicating Data COmes with ites own CHanllenges !
  --We will talk about them a littel later
  
 how quickly we can recover from failure ?
  RPO ( Recovery point objective) MAximum acceptable period of data losss
 Rto ( Recovery Time bjective) : Maximum acceptable downtime
Archieving minum RTo and Rpo is expensive
Trade-off based on the critically of the data

COnsistency
storage COnsistancy - Sychonous replication to all replicas
 -will be slow if you have multipal repicas or standbys
Eventual COnsistency - Asynchronous replication. A little lag -few seconds before the chnage is availabe in all replicas
 -in the intermediate period ,different replicas might return differnt values
uSES when scalability is more important than data integrity
Ex: sCOIAL media POsts - Facebook status messages, Twitter tweets Linked in posts etc 
Read-after-Write COnstitency -- insetrs are immedialty available 
-HOwever ,updates would have evntual constitency

Relational DAtabases

OlTp --(online Transaction Processing)
Application  where large number of users make large number of small  transactions
 --small data reads ,update and deletes
 
 Use cases : make tranditional application -ERP. CRM e-commerce ,banking
 
 Popular databases: 
 Mysql oracal sql server etc
 
 Azure Managed Service
  AZURE sql Databases : MAnaged Microsoft Sql Server
  Azure DAtabases Mysql : Mnaged Mysql

Recommended Azure Managed Service
 Azure Cache for REdish
 Use cases: CAching Session management ,gaming leader bords ,geospatial applications 


Networking

Azure virtul Network
Your own Isolated network i Azure
Network traffic within a virtual Netwok is isolated (not visiable) from all other azure vitual networks
Each virtual network is created in a region

you control all the traffic coming in and going outside a vitual network

(Best practise) create all your Azure resources (compute ,storage.databases etc) whithin a virtual Network

Secure Resources from unauthorized access and
Enable secure communication between your cloude resources

Vitrual Network 

Every vm in a vnet assigned  a private Ip Address
-you can Assign a public ip address and make it static as well
-VMs in the same Vnet can communicate using private Ip addresses
eVEN if they are in different subnets

--Network peering can be use to connect resources in different vitual Networks
 -peered Vitual Networks can be in differnt regions
 
 Azure DDOS
(ddOS) attack : LArge scale attacks to bring your apps down 
 Result : App goes down or become slow .HUge bill because of unlimited auto scaling.
Two Azure DDOs Offering:
DDOs protaction BAsic: protects Against common network layer attcks
 -intelligenty identifies and block DDOs attacks
--Enabled by defualt
--NO extra cost

-DDOs protaction Standard:
 -Mitigates 60 differnt DDos attack types
 provides attack analytics ,metric ,altering and reporting
-get quick support from DDOs protaection RAPID responces (ddr)team
Get a cost guarantee( recive Service cradit if DDOs Attack result in scale-out)
Enable it on the Azure VItual network

Azure Firewall 
Managed network security service to control traffic in and out of a Azure Vitual Network

STateful: Once traffic in is allowed,traffic out is automaticaly allowed
centralized configuration: with one Azure firwall ,you can control traffic to mutipal virtual networks( having hundreds of resources) across multipal subscriptions
Example : if you enterprise has 10 vitual networks (across multipal subscriptionS) with 100 VMS you can control traffic with one azure Firewall

Itegrate with Azure Monitor : provides loggings and analytics

Web application Firewall ( WAF)
Restrict traffic into web application
 --OWASP etc

Network Security Groups(NSG)

Azure Firewall is an external firewall - out side your VIrtual Network 
--NETwork security group is like a internal firwall inside your Virtual Network right before your resources.

Multipal inbound ANd outbound Security rules:

Allow or block traffic  based on source/destination ip Address ,protocol and port
Restrict traffic between resources such as vitual machines and subnets
Attached with subnets and network interfaces

Usecases: Allow access to web server only on port 80 and port 443
(HTTP/HTTPS)
Restrict database access only to web servers .Do NOt Allow direct access to database from outside world/other services.
Restrict outbound traffic from VMS to dowload softwre packages and System updates
  
  
  Azure Private LInk and priavte endpoint

 web application running on Vm deployed to a subnet in a Vnet
 Web application stores data in a sql databases( an azure managaed services)
 
 Need : all communication needs to be private (using private ip address)
 
 SOlution: setup private link and connect using private endpoint

Azure private link: Enable access to azure paas services (azure storage Azure cosmosDb, Azure Sql databse) from resource in your Vnet using private endpoint.
ALl data that flows from a Vm to Sql database is isolated from the inteernet and staye on the microsolft back end

Security best practice -- defences in  depth

A chain is only as strong as it its weekest link" secure at all levels
Physical security: control access to physcial infrastructure (responsiblity of microsoft)

Perimeter: Azure DDOS protaction +azure firewell

Network: Restrict internet access( inbound and outbound)
Restrict communication between resources

COmpute: Secure access to vitual machines
implement endpoint protaction
Ensure that OS and software patches are applied

Application : THink of security from day one
Implement security best practises depending on language and framework 
storage Secrretes in azure key valut
DAta: encrpt data at rest and in transit


Zero trust :
microsoft 's modern security strategy

Zero trust principle:
verify explicitly : use info -identity ,location devices resource,data classification ,time
use least privileage access Assume breach


 CLoude computing: public vs private vs Hybrid clouds

Cloude computing

public cloude
you host everything in the cloud ( you do need a data center abymore)
no capital expenditure required
Hrdware resource are owned by Azure(microsoft)
Hd/w failure and security of the data center are managed by Azure 
private cloude
You host everything in your own data center

Needs capital Expendituure
INcur staffing and maintances expenses for insftrastures

Delivers higher level of securtity and privacy

Hybrid cloude
COmbination of both (public/ private)

Use public cloude for workloloads and private cloude for other

Azure Arc
 hybrid cloude solutin
 
Azure Resource Hierarchy
Hieararchy : Mnagement Group(s) >Subscription(s)>Resourcce Group(s) >Resources

Resoures: VMS , Storage, DAtabases

Resource Group : Organize resource by grouping them into Resource groups

SubScription : MAnage COsts for resource provisioned for differnt temas or differnts projects or differnt business units

management groups: Centralized managaemnet for access policy and compliance across multipal subscriptions

Resource group
Logical container for resources

Associated with a single subscription
Can have multipal resource
 -- a Source can be associated with one and only resouces group
can have resource from multipal rgions
 deketing it deletes all resources under it

Tages assigned to resource group are not automaticaly applied to resource
 --However ,permission /roles assigned to user at the resource group level are inherited by all resources in the group
Resource Groups( like managemnet groups) are free

SUbscription
YOu need a subscription to create resource in Azure
YOu Azure Account can have multipal subscription ans multipal Account administrations
when do you create a new subscrtipon?
I want to manage differnt subscription access- management policies for differnt environments:
 Create differnt subscription for different environmentS
manage distict Azure subscription policies each environments

I want to manage costs across differnt depratment of an organization:

Create differnt subscription for differnt depratments
Create separate biling reports and invoices for each subscription(for department) and manage costs

Azure Policy:
HOw do you ensure that resources stay compliant with your policies?

Create ,assign and manage policies
 -Automatically ensure that resources stay compliant with standard ans SLAs 
Manage compliance of resource across multipal subscriptions
Assigned to a managemt group ,a single subscription or a resource group
Initives: Group of policies
Azure provides some predefined initiatives:
azure secureity becncmark Uk OFFICAL and UK NHS ,HIPAA etc
View them under policy > authring > definitions
COmpliance dashbord: Aggregated view of the overall compliance with options to drill dowm to specific resource/policy
Use cases: Governance for resource consistencey ,regulatory compliances ,securiy cost and managemnt

YOu  achitecture team can createe blue prints adhring to your organization 's standard pattaern and requirements
 ANd your teams use the blue prints to create azure resources
 - BLUEprints can be assigend to individual subscription
 -Blueprints can be used to set up resource grpup whithn subscriptions
Helps teams to quickly set up environments adhering to organizational standards 
 - you can even setup an atomated ci/cd pipeline

Resource Locks
 Prevent accidental deltion/modification of resources
Applicable at multiple levels: SUbscription ,resource group or resource 
  -azureresource inherits locks from its resources group and subscriptionS
 Two optionS:
Cannotdelete and readonly

Locked resource should be unlocked before it can be changed( even by owners)
 Two options:
 Read only LOck: AUthorized userd can read but they can't delete or update the resource
Cannot delete : Authorized users can read and modify but they can't delete the resource

Ex: if a resource group has a delete lock then administator can first removes delete lock before she can delete the resources
 you can have multipal locks at differnt levels
