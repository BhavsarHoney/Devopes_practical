ethernet is used to connect

hubs bridge and switchs
 
 hub :
 

hub  --ONE device directly conected to other device 
switch -- a switch is a broadcast domain

unicast --one system is connected to one syetem

protocol ---set of rules
what is arp ?
ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol. It is a communication protocol used to map an IP (Internet Protocol) address to a corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address in a local network. The primary purpose of ARP is to facilitate communication between devices within the same subnet.
arp -a
differnce between router and switch
A router operates at the network layer and makes decisions based on IP addresses, while a switch operates at the data link layer and uses MAC addresses to forward data within a local network.

ip addressing

mac address -- localy find device 
ip address ---  it is like home address

public and private ip address:

nat -network address translation
             
ipv4 address -192.168.0.6   
subnet mask 255.255.255.0
default gatways 192.168.0.1

classful vs classless addressing :

0.0.0.0 -255.255.255.255

class A address range 1.0.0.0 -127.0.0.0
16,777,214 devices 

class b address 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
65,534devices

class c address ranges 192.0.0.0 to  223.255.255.0
254 devices

binary and decimal :

135 -->  128 64 32 16 8 4 2  1
         1    0  0 0  0 1 1  1

192.168.1.135

why 255 ?
128+64+32+16+4+2+1

why is subnetting necessary?

subnetting is the practice of dividing a larger computer network into smaller,more manageable segments to improve network effciency,security and ip address allocation
