How ansible Works?

controller  ---host 
controller -- where we create playbook and host 
host --  physical server  cloude

Different Inventory Format Types

Ini -The Ini format is the Simplest and most staringhtforward 
Yaml -The yaml format is more structured and flexiable that the Ini

Variable
Stores information that varies with each host

Jinja2 Templating {{ }}



Variable Types 

String Variable 
String Variable in ansiable are Sequesnce of characters.

They can be defind in a playbook inventory or passed as command line arguments.

Nubmber Variables
Nubmbers Variable in Ansible can Hold integer or floting values
They can be used in mathematical operations.

Boolean Variable
Boolean Variable in Ansible can hold either true or false.

They are often used in Conditonal statements.

List Variable 

List Variable in Ansiable can hold an ordered Collection of Values.
The Value can be any type.

Dictionary Variables 
Dictionary Variables in Ansiable can hold a collection of key-value pairs.
The keys and values can be of any type.

 Variable Precedence

Role Defaults  ---lowest pirority
Group Vars     
HostVars
Host Facts
Play Vars
Role Vars
Include Vars
Set Facts
Extras Vars ---Highest Pirority

Variable Scopes -

Host 
play
Global

Magic Variable

if we Create one one Variable on one Host it is not Avaliable on 2 host
if we want to get that variable use Magic Variable

'{{  hostvars['web'].dns_server}}'

groups

{{group['americas']}}

group_names
{{group_names}}

{{inventory_hostname}}

Section 5
Playbook

Playbook -A single YAML file
 play -defines a set of activites(task) to be run on hosts
  task -An Action to be perfomed on the host
   Execute a command 
   Run a Script
   install a package 
   Sutdown/Restart

Run
 Syntax :
   ansible-playbook <playbook file name>


verifying Playbooks

Check mode 
 Ansible's "dry run where no actual changes are made on hosts
 Allow preview of playbook changes without appling them
  Use the --check option to run a playbook in check mode
  Ensures Playbook syntax is erro-free
use the --syntax-check oprtion 

diff mode

Provide a before and After comparision to playbook changes
Understands and Verify the impact of Playbook changes before appling them
Utilize the --diff option to run a playbook in diff mode


Ansiable -Lint
Ansiable lint is a command-line tool that performs linting on Ansiable playbooks, roles and collections
It Checks your code forpotential error ,bugs stylistic error and suspicious constucts.
Its askin to having a Seasoned Ansiable mentors guiding you ,providing Valiable insights and Catching issuse that might have Slipped past your notice
